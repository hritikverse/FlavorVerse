            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <p><b>Boiling chickpeas..</b><br>

                Soak chickpeas in water overnight or for 7 to 8 hours. Add 1/2 tsp Salt, water and close the lid and switch ON<br> the stove on high flame. After 1 whistle, turn the stove on low flame. Let it cook for another<br> 20 minutes now. After 20 minutes, switch OFF the stove for Chickpeas. Do not open the cooker lid. Let the steam take its time to go Off on its own.<br>
                
                Once the cooker runs out its steam, we now have the boiled Chole. Drain their water and take them out in an open<br> pan.Do not throw the drained out water from chole. Keep it aside for later use. You can<br> use it if you find your chole too dry.
