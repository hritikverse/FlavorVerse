            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <p>To begin making Dahi Wale Aloo Recipe, first wash the potatoes thoroughly. Then pressure <br>
                cook them till they are cooked soft, but not completely mushy. You can follow this method <br>
                to learn how to pressure cook them.<br><br>

                Once the pressure has released from the cooker, open the line, drain the water and allow <br>
                the potatoes to cool. Then, peel them and roughly break into chunks.<br><br>
                
                In a large bowl, add curd and besan with a little water and whisk them together to make a <br>
                smooth batter. There should not be any lumps in the curds. Whisk till it is smooth and then set aside.<br><br>
                
                In a wok or kadhai, warm some oil. Add cumin seeds and hing. As soon as cumin begins to crackle, <br>
                add finely chopped onion and saute till the onions soften.<br><br>
                
                Next add the finely chopped ginger, garlic and green chilies along with the curry leaves and <br>
                toss them all together for a couple of minutes.<br><br>
                
                Add the red chilli powder, coriander powder and turmeric and saute the masala well until it <br>
                is cooked through and begins to release oil from the sides. If you find the masala sticking <br>
                at this stage, add a little water (2 tablespoons) in it and toss well.<br><br>
                
                Add the potatoes to the masala and mix again till the potatoes are well-coated.<br><br>
                
                Turn the heat to low and start pouring the beaten curd over the potatoes. Mix well. Adjust salt <br>
                as per your taste and close the lid to allow the curry to simmer for 5 minutes.<br><br>
                
                Once done, turn the heat off, garnish with coriander leaves and serve with Steamed Rice or Phulkas.<br></p>
