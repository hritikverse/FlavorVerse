            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <p>
                <b>Poha:</b> Medium or Thick poha is preferred to make this recipe. When rinsed, it gets fluffy and absorbent.<br> It is easily available in Indian grocery stores. The thin poha doesn't work for this recipe, as it turns mushy when rinsed.<br> You may also use red or brown rice poha.<br>
                <b>Onion:</b> I used finely chopped red onion. You can also yellow or white onions.<br>
                <b>Potatoes:</b> I used one medium Yukon gold potato. However, you can make this poha without potatoes<br> as well.<br>
                <b>Spices:</b> a tempering (tadka) made using mustard seeds, cumin seeds (jeera), curry leaves, and green<br> chilies. Turmeric powder is also used for color and flavor.<br>
                <b>Peanuts:</b> You can add peanuts for the crunch.<br>
                <b>Oil:</b> You can use any cooking oil.<br>
                <b>Garnish:</b> garnish with coriander leaves and freshly grated coconut (optional).<br>

            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <p>Gently rinse poha in a colander under running water 2-3 times until they soften, and then drain out all the water.<br> When you press with your fingers, it should break easily. Keep it aside.<br>


                Heat oil in a Kadai. Add raw peanuts and fry until they turn golden brown. Remove the peanuts to a plate and<br> set them aside.
                
                <br><b>step to roast the peanuts collage.</b><br>
                In the same kadai, add mustard and cumin seeds and let them splutter.<br>
                
                Then add green chilies, curry leaves, and chopped onion. Saute until onions turn soft and translucent.<br>
                
                <b>step to prepare the tempering and cook onions</b> <br>
                Next, add cubed potatoes (or mixed vegetables) and cook for 2-3 minutes. To make simple plain poha, you<br> can skip adding potatoes or veggies.<br>
                
                Cover and cook on medium-low heat till the potatoes are soft and perfectly cooked. Sprinkle some water<br> if required. (You can also use pre-boiled cubed potatoes to it and saute for 2 minutes).<br>
                
                <b>step to cook potatoes for kanda poha</b><br>
                
                Add rinsed and drained poha, turmeric, salt, and sugar. Mix everything well.<br>
                
                If you feel the pohe is too dry, sprinkle some water. Cover it with a lid and cook for 2 minutes on low heat.<br>
                
                <b>step to add pohe and spices and cook</b><br> 
                
                Turn off the heat. Add the lemon juice and roasted peanuts, and give a quick mix. Garnish with coriander leaves.<br>
