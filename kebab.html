            <p class="text-animation">Chicken kebabs are so simple to make, they are basically marinaded chicken, threaded onto skewers <br>

            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <p>There are two things to note in this chicken kebab recipe: 1) The chicken needs to marinate <br>
                for at least 6 hours, preferably overnight. and 2) You need to soak the bamboo skewers in <br>
                hot water for at least 1 hour before assembling the kabobs for the best results (and no charred skewers).<br>
               <b> Marinate chicken</b><br>
                Begin this recipe by making the kabob marinade and marinating the chicken for 6-24 hours. <br>
                Start by cutting the chicken breasts into 1” cubes or strips (your preference for kebabs).<br>

                Then, put the chicken breast pieces into a glass container with a lid or in a plastic bag <br>
                inside another container (in case the bag leaks, the marinade stains).<br>
                Then make the chicken kabob marinade by whisking the ingredients together in a medium-sized bowl.<br>

                Next, pour the marinade over the chicken and turn to coat the chicken.<br>

                Then, marinate the chicken in the refrigerator overnight (or for at least 6 hours).<br>

                <b>Assemble the Chicken Kebabs</b><br>
                Once the chicken has finished marinating, it’s time to assemble the kebabs. Remember, you need to <br>
                soak the bamboo skewers in warm water for at least 1 hour before assembling.<br>

                Or, you can use fire wire to grill the kabobs, then transfer the meat/veggies to a serving <br>
                 to serve. I like this option because it’s reusable and there is no need for soaking.<br><br>

                <b>Important note:</b> Due to the addition of turmeric the marinade will stain anything <br>
                it touches, including your hands, counter tops, etc. I suggest wearing plastic or <br>
                rubber gloves when handling the chicken, assembling the kabobs, etc.<br><br>

                Assemble the kabobs alternating between chicken, bell peppers and onion until all <br>
                the meat/veggies are used.<br><br>

                
                Grill over medium heat for about 5 minutes on the first side, and 3-5 on the second side, <br>
                until chicken reaches an internal temperature of 160 degrees F.<br><br>

                
                <b>Serve</b><br>
                Serve the chicken kebabs warm with your favorite sides. Here are some suggestions:<br>

                I always serve these chicken kabobs with homemade tzatziki and homemade hummus and <br>
                freshly made naan bread or pita bread.<br>
                A fresh salad pairs well with this chicken kebab recipe. Try our favorite Greek salad, <br>
                chickpea salad, burrata salad, or kale salad.<br>
