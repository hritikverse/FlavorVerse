            <h2 color="red">Instructions</h2>
            <p>
<b>Prepare Pizza Dough:</b><br>
 In a medium bowl, whisk together the all-purpose flour, sugar, yeast and salt.<br>
 Add the warm water and olive oil, and stir the mixture with a wooden spoon until the dough just begins<br>
  to come together. It will seem shaggy and dry, but don’t worry.<br>
Scrape the dough onto a well-floured counter top and knead the dough for three minutes. It should quickly<br>
 come together and begin to get sticky. Dust the dough with flour as needed (sometimes I will have to do this<br>
  2 to 3 times, depending on humidity levels) – it should be slightly tacky, but should not be sticking to your<br>
   counter top.  After about 3 minutes, the dough should be smooth, slightly elastic, and tacky. Lightly grease<br>
    a large mixing bowl with olive oil, and place the dough into the bowl.<br>
Cover the bowl with a kitchen towel (or plastic wrap) and allow the dough to rise<br>
		    in a warm, dry area of your
 kitchen for 2 hours or until the dough has doubled in size.<br>
		    <b>>Proofing Tip:</b><br> If your kitchen is very cold,
  heat a large heatproof measuring cup of water<br>
		    in the microwave for 2 to 3 minutes. This creates a nice warm
   environment.<br>
		    Remove the cup and place the bowl with the dough in the microwave until it has risen.<br> 
   [If you are preparing the dough in advance, see the note section for freezing instructions.]<br>
<b>Preheat Oven and Pizza Steel or Stone:</b><br>
 Place the pizza steel (or stone) on the second to top rack of your oven<br>
 (roughly 8 inches from the broiler element), and preheat the oven and steel<br>
		    (or stone) to 550°F (285°C) for
  a minumum of 1 hour. If your oven does not go up to 550°F (285°C)<br>
		    or you are using a delicate pizza stone,
   I recommend heating it to a maximum of 500°F (260°C)<br>
As the oven is preheating, assemble the ingredients. In a small bowl, stir together the pureed tomatoes,<br>
 minced garlic, extra virgin olive oil, pepper, and salt. Set aside another small bowl with the<br>
  cubed mozzarella cheese (pat the cheese with a paper towel to remove any excess moisture).<br>
   Set aside the basil leaves and grated parmigiano-reggiano cheese for easy grabbing.<br>
Separate the dough into two equal-sized portions. It will deflate slightly, but that is OK.<br>
 Place the dough on a large plate or floured counter top, cover gently with plastic wrap,<br> 
 and allow the dough to rest for 5 to 10 minutes.<br>
<b>Assemble the Pizza:</b><br>
 Sprinkle the pizza peel (if you do not own a pizza peel,
 you can try using the back of a half sheet pan - but it is tricky!)<br>
		    with a tablespoon 
 of semolina and dusting of all-purpose flour. Gently use both hands to stretch one<br>
  ball of pizza dough into roughly a 10-inch circle (don’t worry if its not perfectly uniform).<br>
   If the dough springs back or is too elastic, allow it to rest for an additional five minutes.<br>
    The edges of the dough can be slightly thicker, but make sure the center of the dough is thin<br>
     (you should be able to see some light through it if you held it up). Gently transfer the dough<br>
      onto the semolina and flour dusted pizza peel or baking sheet.<br>
Drizzle or brush the dough lightly (using your fingertips) with olive oil (roughly a teaspoon.<br>
 Using a large spoon, add roughly ½ cup of the tomato sauce onto the pizza dough, leaving <br>
 a ½-inch or ¾-inch border on all sides. Use the back of the spoon to spread it evenly and thinly.<br> 
 Sprinkle a tablespoon of parmigiano-reggiano cheese onto the pizza sauce. Add half of the cubed mozzarella,<br>
 distributing it evenly over the entire pizza. Using your hands, tear a few large basil leaves,<br>
  and sprinkle the basil over the pizza. At this point, I’ll occasionally stretch the sides of the dough out<br>
   a bit to make it even thinner. Gently slide the pizza from the peel onto the heated baking stone.<br>
    Bake for 7 to 8 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbling and caramelized<br>
     and the edges of the pizza are golden brown. Note: If you're looking for more color,<br>
      finish the pizza under the low or medium broil setting, but watch it carefully!<br>
Remove the pizza carefully from the oven with the pizza peel, transfer to a wooden cutting board or foil,<<br>
 drizzle the top with olive oil, some grated parmigiano-reggiano cheese, and chiffonade of fresh basil.<br>
  Slice and serve immediately and/or prepare the second pizza.<br>
<b>Serving Tip:</b><br>
 If you’re serving two pizzas at once, I recommend placing the cooked pizza on a separate baking sheet<br> 
while you prepare the other pizza. In the last few minutes of cooking, place the prepared pizza into the oven<br>
 (on a rack below the pizza stone) so that it is extra hot for serving. Otherwise, I recommend serving one<br>
  pizza fresh out of the oven, keeping the oven hot, and preparing the second pizza after people have gone<br>
   through the first one! The pizza will taste great either way, but it is at its prime within minutes out<br>
    of the oven!.<br>
