            <p><h3>How to Make Khichdi</h3>
                Khichdi is made in different ways in different parts of the country. The place I belong to, it’s made<br> 
                like a porridge. So we add extra water with rice and dal and cook it to a porridge like consistency.
                
                In some parts of the country, it’s made almost like a pulao, so if you want your khichdi like that,<br>
                 add only double the amount of water, I added around 4 times.
                
                Also different lentils can be used in khichdi, the most common one in my home is moong dal. It’s <br>
                actually the most easily digestible dal and so used in khichdi.
                
                The funny thing is that since khichdi is generally assumed to be bland and boring, people don’t <br>
                really like it. I know my brothers would never eat it unless and until they were ill!
                
                Luckily me and hubby love it, so I make it whenever we want to eat something light and homemade. <br>
                Hope you guys like this simple Indian recipe.<br><br>
