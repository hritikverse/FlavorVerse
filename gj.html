            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <p>To begin making the Gulab Jamun Recipe with Khoya, take mawa and mix with maida, cooking soda and ghee in a bowl.<br><br>

                Knead everything and add milk / water if needed 1 teaspoon at a time to combine them together to form a firm dough.<br><br>
                
                Knead to a smooth gulab jamun dough and keep it covered for about 10 minutes.<br><br>
                
                Meanwhile, prepare sugar syrup by combining sugar and water in a pan. Heat on low-medium heat. Cook till it <br>
                reaches half string consistency and turn off the heat. Add cardamom powder and few drops of rose essence. <br>
                Keep it covered.<br><br>
                
                Take the resting dough and roll the gulab jamun dough into very small balls without any cracks.<br><br>
                
                Heat oil or ghee for deep frying in a pan or Kadai on medium heat.<br><br>
                
                Once the oil/ghee is heated, drop 4-5 balls at a time and cook till it turns golden brown on all sides. <br>
                Ensure you cook on low to medium heat so the gulab jamuns get cooked from the inside as well.<br><br>
                
                Once done, remove the gulab jamuns carefully and drop them in sugar syrup and allow it to soak in the syrup. <br>
                The Gulab Jamuns will fluff up and almost double in size.<br><br>
                
                Similarly proceed with the remaining khoya jamun balls, fry them and let them soak in syrup for 30 minutes or <br>
                more if needed and serve.<br><br></p>
